=head2 EBT stats tool

NoteInfoGenerator is (apparently) dead. Here's my own attempt at it.

=head2 Requirements

=over 4

=item Perl 5.10.1 or newer.

To figure out what version you have, just run C<perl -v> and look to the first
line of its output.

=over 4

=item Windows

Strawberry Perl: L<http://strawberryperl.com/>.

=item MacOS X

No idea :). I'm told you already have Perl (although maybe not a recent one).

=item Linux

Most probably you already have it.

=item Perl modules

=over 4

=item Config::General

=item DateTime

=item Locale::Country

=item Text::CSV

=item Mojolicious

=back

To install these modules, open a terminal and do the following:

  > cpan
  cpan> install Config::General
  cpan> install DateTime
  cpan> install Locale::Country
  cpan> install Text::CSV
  cpan> install Mojolicious

=head2 Using it

To start EBTST, simply run scripts/ebtst.pl, then point your web browser to
L<http://localhost:8080/>. Feed it your CSV files using the Configuration
section and enjoy your numbers.

By ticking the checkboxes at the left and clicking on C<BBCode>, a separate
browser tab/window is generated with the information in the selected sections
formatted as BBCode, ready to copy and paste into the EBT forum.

=head2 License

EBTST itself is licensed under the GPL version 3.
